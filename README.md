# Spawn
### A random comic generator

## How To Use
Basically, you just open `index.html`. If you want a new comic, refresh. Yep, that's it.

## Todo
* Make it configurable. A random comic is a good place to start, but it would be nice to be able to select the background yourself, for instance.
* I'd like to have the text editable in the page, so you don't have to import it into another application to add text.
* It would also be cool to be able to pipe text in from other sources, like random tweets or something.
